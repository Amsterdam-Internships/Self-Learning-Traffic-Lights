The aim of this project is to improve the traffic flow of Amsterdam to increase its mobility and decrease its CO2 emission. One way to realise this is by decreasing the waiting time of traffic in front of traffic lights. 
Sensor data can be used to simulate the traffic within a virtual simulation environment,
by which the configuration of traffic lights can be optimised by Reinforcement Learning techniques. 
If the performance of the intelligently trained traffic lights surpasses a certain baseline, they can be applied and evaluated in real-life, 
to subsequently be trained with the newly created data.

## In Short

Relevance: With the recent advances in reinforcement learning and the increase of traffic data, it is natural to wonder whether traffic networks can be optimized by machine learning to improve mobility and CO2 emission.

Approach: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with one agent per intersection.

Data: Real-world traffic flow data virtually simulated in the CityFlow Simulator .

Contributions: Revisiting the fundamental framework to apply reinforcement learning techniques to.
- State: what traffic input is necessary, without being abundant, to maximize rewards?
- Actions: what actions does the agent have at its proposal?
- Markov Decision Process: at what timesteps does the agent perform an action?

## How it works

The traffic lights of an intersection get controlled by a reinforcement learning agent.
The Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) of the agent gets trained by trial-and-error within a virtual environment, 
which simulates the traffic flow of a given data set of traffic trajectories.

[`dqn_train.py`](./src/dqn_train.py) creates and constantly refreshes the learning data set by running the simulation engine under the current policy of the trained agent.  
[`dqn_agent.py`](./src/dqn_agent.py) learns from the experiences by updating the parameters of its neural network.  
[`dqn_model.py`](./src/dqn_model.py) declares the neural network of dqn_agent.py.
