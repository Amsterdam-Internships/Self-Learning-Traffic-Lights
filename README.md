# Self-Learning-Traffic-Lights
Master thesis Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam as intern at the municipality of Amsterdam.

Description
The aim of this project is to improve the traffic flow of Amsterdam to increase its mobility and decrease its CO2 emission. 
One way to realise this is by decreasing the waiting time of traffic in front of traffic lights. 
Sensor data can be used to simulate the traffic within a virtual environment (e.g. Simulation of Urban MObility (https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/index.html)),
by which the configuration of traffic lights can be optimised by Reinforcement Learning techniques. 
If the performance of the intelligently trained traffic lights surpasses a certain baseline, they can be applied and evaluated in real-life, 
to subsequently be trained with the newly created data.
